## Hello! I'm Igor, Welcome To My GitHub Profile.
#### *Sorry for the mess, not the best on keeping stuff organized.*

## My main languages are *JavaScript (TypeScript, React, NodeJS)* and *C# (ASP.NET)*.
#### I mostly work with Web Development, and have been learning and working with programming since 2019.
 
 Currently focused on pushing my JavaScript skills to the limit, and intending to learn C and more about data structures and memory management
